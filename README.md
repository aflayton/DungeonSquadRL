DungeonSquadRL
==============
This was a hobby project undertaken on my own in order to apply what I had learned about Python.
It is a text-based hack'n'slash RPG with some procedurally generated content.
The mechanics of the game are based off of an open source tabletop RPG ruleset designed for children called "Dungeon Squad." (http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/dungeon_squad.pdf)
Future plans include: adding a GUI instead of running it through the terminal, adding an infinite mode, adding a save feature.
